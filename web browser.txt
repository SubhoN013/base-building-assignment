A web browser is a software application used to access and navigate the World Wide Web (WWW). It allows users to view web pages, interact with web-based applications, and access various types of multimedia content on the internet. Web browsers interpret and display web content written in languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key features of web browsers include:

1.Graphical User Interface (GUI): Web browsers typically have a user-friendly interface that includes a window for displaying web content, navigation buttons (such as back, forward, refresh), a URL bar for entering web addresses, and various menu options for configuring settings.

2.Rendering Engine: This is the core component of the browser responsible for interpreting and displaying web content. Different browsers may use different rendering engines, such as Blink (used by Google Chrome), WebKit (used by Safari), and Gecko (used by Mozilla Firefox).

3.Tabbed Browsing: Most modern web browsers support tabbed browsing, allowing users to open multiple web pages in separate tabs within the same browser window. This feature makes it easy to switch between different websites without opening multiple browser windows.

4.Bookmarks: Web browsers allow users to save and organize their favorite websites for quick access. Bookmarks can be organized into folders and synced across multiple devices in some browsers.

5.Extensions and Add-ons: Many web browsers support extensions or add-ons that enhance functionality and provide additional features. These can include ad blockers, password managers, language translators, and developer tools.

6.Security Features: Web browsers implement various security measures to protect users from malware, phishing attacks, and other online threats. These may include built-in pop-up blockers, malware scanners, and secure browsing modes.

Some popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Opera. Each browser may offer unique features and performance characteristics, catering to different user preferences and needs.
